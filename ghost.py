"""Notes
This is a basic speech recognition layout.  In future videos we will enhance this with the ability
to have multiple inputs and outputs, to make the system more reliable nd believable. We will also add some
code to make the system more effective, ignore background noise and make choices from speech
input.  This code will get you started though and show you some basic principles."""
